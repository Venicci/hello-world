Hello Hoomans!

I am Venicci, the last descendant of the pasta regime. Brothers to Da Vinci and Fettuccine. I once dreamed to be a superhero but I didn't have powers unlike my older brothers so I decided to be a songwriter and be a rapper. I can't rap like Eminem but I can rap like LilDicky. I have an Instagram account in case anyone will be interested and it's (@benitsie). Y'all can follow me there to know more about my work. I studied Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I am now working as a Service Desk Associate from Cognizant Technology Solutions. I'm so good with music and I'm willing to share my knowledge to everyone.

Prost!
